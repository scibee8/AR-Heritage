This is the code associated with my AR web app I made for my final project in ANP 412. The link to the website is: https://scibee8.github.io/AR-Heritage/
I would like to give credit where credit is due and recognize the Natural History Museum Vienna for the 3D model of the 
Venus of Willendorf (link to the model: https://skfb.ly/ovnFr). I would also like to credit Nicol√≤ Carpignoli and his medium article for some inspiration 
(link: https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-location-based-augmented-reality-web-app-a841956eed2c). However, I ended up using this example I found in the AR.js 
documentation as a starting point and made some modifications from there 
(see this link for the example code I ended up modifying: https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/location-based-aframe/).

ALSO IF THE MODEL IS NOT SHOWING UP ON YOUR MOBILE DEVICE TRY REQUESTING THE MOBILE VERSION OF THE WEBSITE OR VICE VERSE ON YOUR PHONES BROWSER.
